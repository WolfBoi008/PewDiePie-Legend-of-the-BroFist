# Archipelago Manual - PewDiePie: Legend of the BroFist

This is one of my favorite platformers to exist, and I think it'd be an interesting Manual as an excuse to play it.

## Notes
- I recommend doing this from a 100% save file (or at least a file that's done everything except Pug Mode and maybe buying max health for all of the characters).
- You start with PewDiePie and Marzia (in case you want to do Co-Op :D), no other characters, no other abilities, and can only play the first level. The other levels must be unlocked to advance.
- Bosses are unlocked every 10 patches, in story order. If you have the key and patches needed to access the boss, you can fight them.
-- This means General Barrel is at 10 (and Vehicle Key), Generoll Barrel is at 20 (and Ice Key), and Falcon Lover is at 30 (and Africa Key).

## Goal
- Defeat King Barrel in the final level, "Final Showdown". You must obtain 40 patches to battle him.

## Items
- Characters
- Attack "Spells"
- Defense "Spells"
- Patches (for unlocking bosses and goal)
- Themed Keys (for unlocking levels)

## Checks
- Beating levels
- Collecting Patches
